No further transcripts here.

In its capacity as an entertainment production and distribution company, [The Rusty Quill](https://rustyquill.com/) is aware that it would be unprofessional to expect unpaid volunteers to handle text accessibility for [The Magnus Protocol](https://rustyquill.com/show/the-magnus-protocol/), the sequel to their most popular in-house venture.

As such, my sources (which exist) have informed me that TRQ's [misconfigured SharePoint folder with PDFs in it](https://rustyquillcom.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/ElFMfJSzHzRMhhWGghFX8E8Bg27o0_Amiemvu0Hqq8D6Yg) is merely a temporary stopgap, and will soon be replaced by a responsive and screenreader-accessible HTML transcript archive, run in-house by someone who gets paid to do it.

Because these guys are professionals, and they put out a lot of podcasts, and they charge other people to help them with *their* podcasts, and they have had 22 months to hire an accessibility consultant to tell them what to do and then hire a web designer to do it for them.

They've got this! They do not need help! They are *going* to figure out how to correctly use the [`alt`](https://www.w3.org/WAI/alt/) and [`aria`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics) attributes, and they're going to do it *very soon,* according to my sources (they are real).

This site was originally intended to be a temporary thing for my personal use, and maybe that of a couple other people who followed me on Tumblr. I throw up a lot of nearly-identical [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-generated sites when going through batch-exported/-cleaned text, because it makes it easier to switch from PC to phone, keep reading when I'm out of the house, etc. They stay up for a couple weeks max.

That is why this site has a stupid and Google-hostile name, and it never got its own domain, and it uses [the popular Solarized technical color scheme](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) instead of something custom-made. I expected to be shutting it down pretty quickly, because TRQ publicly positions itself as a progressive company, and -- as such -- it would be a little fucked-up of them to ask for more money on Patreon to set up an accessible transcript archive, and then not do it. And it is a little fucked-up.

It is a little fucked-up that a Github Pages site with a joke title ending with "Unofficial" has been regularly confused with an official resource that someone was getting paid to run for several years now. It could be more fucked-up, but still! The URL says "snarp" in it. None of this is real. I shouldn't be here. *You* shouldn't be here!

If you are, however, please consider giving that $2-10 requested by the TRQ Patreon to [AppalReD Legal Aid](https://www.ardfky.org/donate).[^1] It will go to help people who have suffered from unfair loss of their disability benefits, workplace/housing/academic discrimination, housing insecurity due to natural disasters and the gutting of FEMA, and other problems that are more fucked-up than whatever's going on with TRQ's SharePoint folder.

[^1]: I do not work there and they do not know who I am.

Please [email me](mailto:snarp@snarp.work) if you know why they're using SharePoint.
